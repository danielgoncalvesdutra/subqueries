# Subqueries - the cherry on top
Think of a query as a cake. A cake can have multiple layers contained within it and even layers within those layers. Each of these layers are our subqueries, and when you put all of the layers together, you get a cake (query). Usually, you will find subqueries nested in the SELECT, FROM, and/or WHERE clauses. There is no general syntax for subqueries,  but the syntax for a basic subquery is as follows:

    (SELECT [DISTINCT] subquery_select_argument
    FROM {table_name | view_name}
    {table_name | view_name} ...
    [WHERE search_conditions]
    [GROUP BY aggregate_expression [, aggregate_expression] ...]
    [HAVING search_conditions])

There are a few rules that subqueries must follow:

    Subqueries must be enclosed within parentheses

    A subquery can have only one column specified in the SELECT clause. But if you want a subquery to compare multiple columns, those columns must be selected in the main query.

    Subqueries that return more than one row can only be used with multiple value operators, such as the IN operator which allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.

    A subquery canâ€™t be nested in a SET command. The SET command is used with UPDATE to specify which columns (and values) are to be updated in a table.

The HAVING Clause
    The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.

    SQL HAVING Syntax
    SELECT column_name, aggregate_function(column_name)
    FROM table_name
    WHERE column_name operator value
    GROUP BY column_name
    HAVING aggregate_function(column_name) operator value;
